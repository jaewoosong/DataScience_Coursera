# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

* This R script analyzes the data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

* The data are about wearable computing, and are from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

* It is easy to run this R script.

  - Just run **run_analysis.R** on your computer!

  - It will download the necessary file(s) from the internet.

  - Then it will generate **tidySet.csv**, which is a *tidy* summary of the raw data.

In detail:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

More details are written in the script file as comments.

**CodeBook.md** is (of course) a codebook for the R script.

Thank you!!!
