# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

It is easy to run this R script.

Just run **run_analysis.R** on your computer!

It will download the necessary file(s) from the internet.

Then it will generate **tidySet.csv**, which is a *tidy* summary of the raw data.

**CodeBook.md** is (of course) a codebook for the R script.

Thank you!!!
